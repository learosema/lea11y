To check whether all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard, hit the
<kbd>tab</kbd> key repeatedly until you get through the whole page back to the

- Do you see which element is currently focused?
- Are all interactive elements reachable?
- Does the order of highlighted items make sense to you?
