Some browsers need additional configuration to fully support navigation
via the keyboard.

Safari and Vivaldi don't focus every element on tab.
Other browsers should work just fine.

## Safari

- Go into the settings, advanced
- Tick "Press tab to highlight each item on a webpage".

## Vivaldi

- Go into settings, keyboard, tick "TAB focuses all controls"
- Go into settings, webpages, webpage focus, "Focus All Controls and Links"
