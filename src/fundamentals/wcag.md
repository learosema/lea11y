There's the WCAG. It is made by the [W3 Consortium](https://www.w3.org).
It is THE guideline for accessible web content and baseline for
most accessibility laws and policies.

See: <https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/>

Having a glance at this can be overwhelming. It still is very overwhelming for me.

For accessibility conformance testing, they've also put together a guideline.
It starts with a couple easy checks followed by more testing in detail.
