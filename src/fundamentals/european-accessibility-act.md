The European Accessibility Act is a EU policy which was made in 2019.
It's not a law itself but a template for how an accesibility law in
should be implemented in EU countries.

The german law based on this policy is the "Accessibility Strengthening Act".
In german: <span lang="de">Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz</span>,
abbreviated: BFSG.

The policy has set a deadline for the laws to be implemented and enacted, which
was end of June 2025. Due to this, there was (and still is) a lot of
fearmongering in "professional" social media such as LinkedIn: Better get an
accessible web page or get sued.

However, the BFSG doesn't apply to everyone. It doesn't apply to
smaller companies with less than 10 people and an annual revenue
less than 2 million €.

The policy is not only about web accessibility, but also accessibility in real life,
such as accessible banking terminals and accessible public transport.

Some companies argue the law doesn't apply to them. For example, when they make B2B
software, not targeted at end-users.
