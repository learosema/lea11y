According to DEStatis, there are 7.3 million people with a severe disability in Germany.
That's 9.3%.

When just taking the people into account who are 65 and older,
the percentage is 24,5%.

So if you wanna exclude a bunch of people upfront
with the stuff you build, then don't build with accessibility in mind.

The source I linked only mentions "severe disabilities" (whatever that means).
