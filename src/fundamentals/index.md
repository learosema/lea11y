In this chapter we are going through a couple
fundamentals about disabilities. This is more
non-technical but it's important for
understanding the different needs of your users.

This is roughly what you need to learn for the
CPACC certification, but way less detailed and not complete.

TODO:

- temporary vs permanent vs situational
- assistive technology
- disability etiquette or how not to be an asshole
- theory: medical vs social model of disability
- inspiration exploitation
