This is my website which focuses around the topic of web accessibility.

I'm neither IAAP certified nor working as an accessibility specialist.
So, why did I make a website about accessibility then?

Because I think that you don't need to be an accessibility specialist
and/or IAAP certified to make accessible websites.

## Why?

Because it matters. Sooner or later to your future self.

## But there are already

Yes, there are already a lot of accessibility courses and other valuable
resources.

I find this reasoning a bit irritating. It's like saying: "Why should
I bother making a website? There are already a lot of them online".

Or worse: "Why bothering writing content for a website? Let AI do this for you,
so you have time for other things."

When I let AI do it for me, I'd probably spend the "saved" time watching TV
or playing video games. But this way, I wouldn't learn anything about accessibility.

Writing is a way for me to learn.

Furthermore, a lot of good accessibility content is behind a paywall. While
I think accessibility expertise should be paid, I think the very basics should
be available for free. This is what I want to try to provide with this website.

## "Your stuff is terribly wrong!"

Yes, I was actually afraid putting up a website on accessibility. I could get
feedback like this and I don't want to be part of the group of people who
publish low-quality content, misinformation and bad techniques in accessibility.

To be honest: this is where I need your help.
I don't know whether my content is good.

I usually learn about accessibility in my unpaid spare time.
And not really in my career as a frontend developer, unfortunately.

Confusingly, accessibility mostly doesn't matter too much in my paid job.
There is often no budget for it, or it is considered as something
to be fixed in the aftermath.

I'm very frustrated about this and I think this is structurally broken
and needs to be fixed, and using AI for magically fixing it is the
wrong path.

So, long story short: I would appreciate it very much if you review my content
and report bugs, or directly correct them yourself.

Low-barrier ways to do so are pull requests (probably via the in-place editing feature).

You can also create an issue or write an email
to `lea "et" lea.lgbt` (with `"et"` being a `@`) or ping me on [mastodon](https://lea.lgbt/@lea).

I would like to credit reviewers on the content they review, unless they disagree.
