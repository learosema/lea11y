## Quick Accessibility Testing tips

- Check the accessibility tree inside your browser developer tools
- Check if the website is completely operable via keyboard
- Check if all inputs have a label associated
- Check if all buttons have text
- Check if all images have alt text
- Check if the document language is set correctly.
- Check your color contrasts are okay.
  You can manually check it via the [WebAIM Contras Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- You can use automated tool like
  Lighthouse for this, which is integrated into Chrome Dev Tools.
- See also the [WebAIM Million Report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) mentioning
  the most common accessibility issues. Only focusing on these would already
  catch a lot of issues.
