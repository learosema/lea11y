This is Lea's accessibility website.

Lea is a very experienced senior frontend developer based in the Hamburg 
area.

Oddly enough, working in the industry for over a decade, accessibility is
pretty neglected in her daily work.

This is why she made this website. You can read more about her in
the [About](./about/) page. Or dig right in.

As of current, most of the content is not reviewed yet.
Chances are this content is not complete, outdated, or even total crap.
Unreviewed content is marked accordingly.

Long story short: This web page is under construction.
A perfect oppportunity to insert an "under construction" gif from
the 90s here.
