This is Lea's accessibility website.

Lea is not an accessibility expert, but a senior frontend developer.
Oddly enough, working in the industry for over a decade, accessibility is
pretty neglected in her client projects, which frustrates her.

This is why she made this website. You can read more about her in 
the [About](./about/) page. Or dig right in.

So, most of the things she learned about accessibility was in her spare time, 
and not in her professional career.

As of current, most of the content is not reviewed yet. 
Chances are this content is not complete, outdated, or even total crap.
Unreviewed content is marked accordingly.

Long story short: This web page is under construction.
A perfect oppportunity to insert an "under construction" gif from
the 90s here.
