If you work as a frontend developer working for several clients, chances
are that you heard there's "no budget for accessibility".

I think this especially a reason to start integrating basic
accessibility checks into the development process.

They are really low effort to follow.

The techniques below will not guarantee you will get an accessible product in 
the end, but it usually saves you from having to do expensive
"let's fix it afterwards"measures.

## Low hanging fruits

The [WEBAIM million report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) mentions
the 6 most common accessibility issues they found in a million webpages.

They are usually easy to fix and even autodetectable. Focusing on
these problems alone would already improve accessibility significantly.

You can click on each of these sub articles to learn more about the issues
in detail.

- [Low color contrast](./low-color-contrast.md)
- [Missing alternative text](./missing-alt-text.md)
- [Missing labels on form controls](./missing-labels.md)
- [Empty buttons (without text)](./empty-buttons.md)
- [Empty links (without text)](./empty-links.md)
- [Missing document language](./missing-document-language.md)

## Using automated tools to detect these

## More low effort important things

A lot of accessibility problems are not autdetectable. However,
they are still relatively easy to fix. It's not rocket science.
