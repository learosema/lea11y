As of current, I still have to learn a lot about web accessibility. Nevertheless, I'm trying my best to make this website as accessible as possible to everyone.

There are no known issues to me. Please reach out if you find issues.

You can write an email
to `lea "et" lea.lgbt` (with `"et"` being a `@`) or ping me on [mastodon](https://lea.lgbt/@lea).

You can also write an issue or create a pull request on <https://github.com/learosema/lea11y>.
