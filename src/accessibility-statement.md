# Accessibility statement

I'm trying my best to make this website as accessible as possible to everyone.

This website uses no JavaScript, just plain HTML and CSS and
structuring it with proper chapters and subchapters, using headlines.
As soon as I reach a heading level of 4, it is time for me to simplify the structure.

Following this approach, chances are this content is already pretty
accessible. But usually, there is no 100% warranty.

So, I would appreciate if you report accessibility problems to me.

You can also create an issue or write an email
to `lea "et" lea.lgbt` (with `"et"` being a `@`) or ping me on [mastodon](https://lea.lgbt/@lea).
