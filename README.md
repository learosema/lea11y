# HTML Hacking Session

This is a minisite. It started as a HTML and Accessibility basics session at the
[Socrates 2025 unconference](https://socrates-conference.de)

It is deployed as a github page: <https://lea11y.de/>.

## Running it locally

This site was built using the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and [lightning css](https://lightningcss.dev).

After an `npm install`, you can run `npm run dev` to run a development server.
